--------------------------
Phase 3 - Laying down the state

In Phase 3, we'll build get the state of our app finished.

This is part of a series of videos where we build a Cyberpunk 2077-inspired Spotify Music controller that can be embedded in a user's browser.
They'll be able to play/pause, navigate to the next/previous track, and hide the player.

All of this done with ReactJS, Google Chrome, and the Spotify API.

Simply run an

```
npm install
```

To build and run the project, run

```
npm run build
```

To view the 'Foreground' page, navigate to localhost:8080/foreground.html.

To view the 'Options' page, navigate to localhost:8080/options.html.

To view the 'Popup' page, navigate to localhost:8080/popup.html.

The port should be 8080. Check the console log to confirm.
