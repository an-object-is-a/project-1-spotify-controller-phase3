# project-1-spotify-controller-phase3
In Phase 3, we'll build get the state of our app finished.

This is part of a series of videos where we build a Cyberpunk 2077-inspired Spotify Music controller that can be embedded in a user's browser.
They'll be able to play/pause, navigate to the next/previous track, and hide the player.

All of this done with ReactJS, Google Chrome, and the Spotify API.
